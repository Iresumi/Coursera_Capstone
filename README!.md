Hi! Welcome  to my GitHub repository!
I have a bad new and a good new..
The bad new is I discovered GitHub doesnt support Folium Map, so if you want to see the maps, I attached them in this README file, you can see them below
AND THE GOOD NEW... to make up to you the  previus point, feel free the dataset I built with SQL, the name is export(2).csv
this dataset was created trough SQL with another giant dataset that contained over 10 000 rows, and every single ZIP code Canada
I fixed this and made it easier to work with, now only contains 102 rows. I HOPE YOU FIND IT USEFUL! GOOD LUCK!

YOU CAN SEE THE MAPS BELOW:
